# ML_R_Linear-Logistic_Regression
As we know there are a lot of integrated data sets in R. 
This module contains the explainiation and code of 

1. Linear Regression on SEATBELTS dataset
2. Logistic Regression on STORMS dataset
3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which a useful technique for exploratory data analysis,
