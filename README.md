# Linear and Logistic Regression, PCA and SVD 
As we know there are a lot of integrated data sets in R. 
This module contains the explainiation and code of:- 

1. Linear Regression on SEATBELTS dataset
2. Logistic Regression on STORMS dataset
3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which a useful technique for exploratory data analysis, 
   allowing you to better visualize the variation present in a dataset with many variables.
4. Singular value decomposition (SVD) which a type of matrix factorization. 
   The SVD is used widely both in the calculation of other matrix operations, 
   such as matrix inverse, but also as a data reduction method in machine learning.
